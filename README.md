Harjoitustyö HTMX:llä (Net Ninja - HTMX for Beginners https://www.youtube.com/@NetNinja/playlists)

This project was about using basic HTMX-syntax to create an application for displaying, adding, deleting, and searching books. The app uses express to handle requests, and combines the HTML-page dynamically using HTMX.

To run the app, make sure you are in the "HTMX-harjoitusty-" -folder inside terminal and use the command "npm install" to download node-modules -folder, after which the app can be run.
